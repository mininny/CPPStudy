## Expression and Statements
In c++, there are expressions and statements.

### Expression
In  c++, expression is rather `a value`, or a combination of `value and operator`. All expressions have a single value.  

- `22 + 26` is an expression of value `48`. 
- `x = 10` is an expression that returns the value of `10`.  This allows us to declare variables like this: `x = y = z = 10`.
- `x > z` is another expression that returns `bool` depending on the result of the comparison. 

### Statements
Statements, are expressions with semicolons(`;`) at the end of them. However, it can turn out as a meaningless statements. 

- `age = 100;` is a statement that applies 100 to `age`.
- `number + 3;` is a statement, but it has no meaning, passing the execution to the next line without doing anything. 

## Logical Operators in c++
- `&&` : AND
- `||` : OR
- `!` : NOT
- `? :` : Ternary operator
